If you work on digital products but don’t write code, there’s a gap between your ideas and the end user.

Everything you design, spec, or strategize must pass through developers (and increasingly AI) before it ever sees the light of day.

That gap creates friction, misunderstandings, delays, and missed opportunities. The best user experiences are shaped not just by good ideas, but by strong technical collaboration.

Traditionally, getting better at technical collaboration meant learning to code yourself. But, that takes years of sustained effort and costs an arm and a leg. Not to mention that the time spent learning to code is time you’re not spending on your other skills.

We believe there’s a better way.

Technically Lit exists to close the gap between nontechnical product professionals and the technology they work with every day–without learning to code.

We’re sharing how product professionals, like yourself, approach technical collaboration so you can learn how to make smarter technical decisions, build better products, and communicate clearly with developers and AI tools alike.

Together, let’s get Technically Lit.
